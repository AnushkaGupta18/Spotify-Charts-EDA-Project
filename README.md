## Spotify-Charts-EDA-Project

The dataset has been taken from kaggle, and it contains information of all the "Top 200" and "Viral 50" charts published globally by Spotify. Spotify publishes a new chart every 2-3 days. The dataset has been used to identify the different artists people listen to most across the world, and the growth of various artists through the years.

Python along with its different libraries such as Pandas, Numpy and Matplotlib has been used to analyze and visualize the data provided.
